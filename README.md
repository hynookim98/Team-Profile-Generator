# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description 
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI coding Bootcamp. This program was created to be able to create a webpage by taking in user input taking in information about the team for a project. This code runs in the terminal and will generate a HTML page for you depending on your input. 
Here is a screenshot of the deployed HTML page generated through the terminal.

Thank you for using my code and taking the time to try out my program.

## Installation
To use the program you need to install inquirer and jest through the terminal. Use "npm init -y" in the terminal. Then run "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to install the inquirer package. Use "npm install --save-dev jest" to install jest. 

## Usage 
To use the program run "node index.js" to start the program via the terminal. Then answer all the questions creating as many employees as needed. After done, press finish and the program will automatically generate a new HTML page for you  in the 'dist' folder.
